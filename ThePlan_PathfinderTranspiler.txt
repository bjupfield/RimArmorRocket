okay for pathfinding there is a suprisingly limited amount of things that we need to adjust so that we
can use the pathfinder to find our xzpath...

tuning.custom  == null
lordwalkgrid == null
flag5 == false
allowedarea == null
bytegrid == null (this one we can just set to null thankfully)
create our own custom traverseparms

pathgrid.walckablefast needs to always give true, except for when it is a heavy roof
	we than need to make it continue if in the if statemetn of if(!pathGrid.WalkableFast(num12))
	with another check like if(traverseParms.mode == Our custom TraverseParm mode, its a bit and he uses 7 so we will take the eigth value and so it will be == to 7) continue
	
	the walkablefast will be set through the creation of a static pathing context for our maps,
	pathing context are created for every map, and there are two context, one that looks at fences and not fences
	ours will be a new one that looks at heavy roofs,
	after a bit of thought into this, because this is a sealed class without any "useless" variables
	that I could adjsut to signify it is my object type we will have to use a nasty function in the calculatedcostat
	function that checks if this pathgrid is in the map.mapcomponents.mymapcustommapcomponents,
	luckily as stated before we will need a static handler for maps that contains this grid, this is what
	our mapcompenent will be
	the mapcompenent will contain our pathingcontext... which is just a small holder for our pathgrid
	pathgrids on apparently only updated upon mapload... so that is when we will update our pathgrids too,
	inside our mapcomponent
	so our mapcompenent will have two functions and one object inside it
	^ furthermore our mapcompenent will need to be a subclass of the class custommapcomponent
	the object will be our pathcontext
	the functions
		isthisgridacustomgrid => returns true if the grid is the one in our map context
		init function => recalculates all percieved cost and does necessary builds if the objects dont exist
	our transpiler for the the pathgrid.calculatedcost will
		add a check by calling map.mapcomponents.find(ourmapcompenenttype).?isthisgridacustomgrid(this)
		and if it passes the check it will check if map.roofGrid.RoofAt(c).?isThickRoof == true

		
edifice grid needs to contain no buildings...
blueprint grid needs to contain no blueprints
