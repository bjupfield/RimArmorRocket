to access what a storagegroup is holding use the function in any class that inherits from storagegroup,
mything.storagegroup.HeldThings();
^this will retrieve all things in the storage group, which I think includes linked storage, so like linked shelfs and whatever

|||||
This is the section that will describe how the class will be set up

FIRST and FOREMOST:
	The way we store things in our thing is with inheriting the IThingHolder class and creating a variable inside the class
of type ThingOwner and naming it innerContainer, which is convention. This thing will hold our items for us, it is what we
are using instead of the storagegroup things, I am allowing myself to use this because there are two things that hold items
storaggroups and thingowners, for IThingholder the way to access items is through 
object.innerContainer[x], where innercontainer acts as a list
and for classes that inheret from istroagegroupmember the access of things is listed above


To regulate what can be stored in the building we override the function Accepts() and we make it return true if it can be
stored for this we will need to check if the item is either armor or weapons, this is pretty much stolen from armorrack, I didnt
even have the idea to store weapons before this
	for weapons we check if there is already more weapons in storage than the pawn can equip
	for apparel we check for all stored apparel if the attempted storage apparel overlaps with any of the layers, with the
		function provided by rimworld ApparelUtility.CanWearTogether()

actually, fuck it we are going to use his, his code is good, im looking at his code for ideas to much, ill just have a setting
in my mod that allows for his item racks to be removed and just for the rocket one to be in the game

okay ive been looking at his mod and it looks like the class i need to target is the armorrack class,
we than need to override
accepts => make our new canstores work
canstoreapparel => needs to check against assignedarmor
canstoreweapon => needs to check against assignedweapon
getgizmos => new command action of assign armor to rack which assigns armor to the rack
new vars
list assignedarmor
thing weapon
bracelet attached bracelet

we need to make several other things,

	like a new command action as said above that assigns a specific armor to the armor rack

	the default armorrack def uses two inspectortab attributes, the ITAB_Storage and the custom armorrakcs.itab,
	^ i want to get rid of both

	the default armorrack uses a thingcomp that just adds a few gizmos and float option, just do that in the class
	it also is the thing that does the draw function, so we will actually keep it... uggh
	so we will make a class that inherits from this and override the 
	compfloatmenuoptions() => this is the float menu options when clicked on by pawn, we need it to check against three things
		rack empty => have float menu option display that the pawn can place armor set in rack
		rack contains items => have float menu option display that pawn can place armor in rack but the items that overlap already in the rack will be dropped
		pawn has bracelet => bind bracelet to the rack
	this means for the def we need to a thingcomp of this class

	new host of new jobs that the pawns can do to put armor into rack
