okay planning on making an extension of the apparel that just has the launch armor func for the bracelet

the extension will just be a holder that alerts our linked armor stand when the pawn is drafted
for this to work the rimworld.pawn_draftcontroller will need to be transpilled
the function set_Drafted will need to be transpilled in the if(draftedInt) statement
where we will check to see if the player has any apparel that has our compclass,
to do this will check the apparel on the pawn using the apparal?.wornApparel call 
to than check if any of this apparel has our compclass
we will call the function notifyArmorLauncher which will than tell the launcharmor function to send the armor to our linked pawn
and thats pretty much it for the drafting functionality

to assign its link it will just be through a right click on an armor stand with a pawn selected
i dont know how to do this...
to do this, i need to make a job driver, work giver, and a job, which is just the linker of the job driver and the jobs name
actually scratch that, we dont want a work giver, because a work giver is something that assigns work automatically, like flicking a switch or
producing a bill, which will be done automatically by the colonist. What we want is something similar to the pick up item command and put in inventory,
which does not have a work giver, but instead makes the work inside the function addhumanlikeorders with the function jobmaker.makejob,
which requires a jobdriver and a job
so what we need to "program" is the jobdriver only, and what we need to "list" is the job def in our job
